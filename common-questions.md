# Common Questions

## Have you ever had to motivate others? How did you do it?

Situation: When COVID first started to get bad in the US, the orders in our warehouse went through the roof.

Task: Unfortunately, I had to break the news to one of our crews that the warehouse was making it mandatory to work six days a week, ten hour shifts.

Action: I let the crew know that the work they were doing was important, and that people were relying on us to keep stores stocked with product. I also let them know that I would also be working this same schedule, and I would be doing all that I could to send people home early.

Result: We had to work this schedule for two weeks, and the crew worked very hard the entire time. We also had almost call-ins during these two weeks, which was very rare.

## Tell me about a time when you set and achieved a specific goal.

Situation: I was a newer employee at my warehouse job, and I was expected to meet a certain standard of stocking freight within a given ammount of time. The first time my supervisor timed me, I was only half as efficient as I needed to be.

Task: I knew that I was lacking in certain aspects of the job, but I assumed that my other strengths would be enough for me to meet the company's standard. This was obviously not true.

Action: My supervisor gave me good feedback on how I could improve in the skills where I was lacking, and she told me that if I did not improve I would no longer have a job.

Result: I took what my supervisor told me to heart, and her brutal honesty served as a great motivator. I did improve my skills enough to meet standards, and eventually greatly succeeded it. The areas where I was lacking actually became my strengths, and this job helped get me noticed enough to recieve a promotion.
