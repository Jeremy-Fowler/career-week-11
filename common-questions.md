# Common Questions

## Have you ever had to motivate others? How did you do it?

Situation: When COVID first started to get bad in the US, the orders in our warehouse went through the roof.

Task: Unfortunately, I had to break the news to one of our crews that the warehouse was making it mandatory to work six days a week, ten hour shifts.

Action: I let the crew know that the work they were doing was important, and that people were relying on us to keep stores stocked with product. I also let them know that I would also be working this same schedule, and I would be doing all that I could to send people home early.

Result: We had to work this schedule for two weeks, and the crew worked very hard the entire time. We also had almost call-ins during these two weeks, which was very rare.

## Tell me about a time when you set and achieved a specific goal.

Situation: I was a newer employee at my warehouse job, and I was expected to meet a certain standard of stocking freight within a given ammount of time. The first time my supervisor timed me, I was only half as efficient as I needed to be.

Task: I knew that I was lacking in certain aspects of the job, but I assumed that my other strengths would be enough for me to meet the company's standard. This was obviously not true.

Action: My supervisor gave me good feedback on how I could improve in the skills where I was lacking, and she told me that if I did not improve I would no longer have a job.

Result: I took what my supervisor told me to heart, and her brutal honesty served as a great motivator. I did improve my skills enough to meet standards, and eventually greatly succeeded it. The areas where I was lacking actually became my strengths, and this job helped get me noticed enough to recieve a promotion.

## Tell me about a time when you made sure a customer was pleased with your service.

Situation: If a local store urgently needed something from our warehouse, they could could send an employee to our warehouse to pick up product.  We called this a will-call.

Task: I was usually asked to deal with will-calls.  

Action: Even if I was busy, I always took the time to help employees load product into their vehicle.

Result: The employees were always very grateful to have help loading product into their vehicles, and I was even recognized and thanked when shopping in their stores.

## Talk about a time when you had to work closely with someone whose personality was very different from yours.

Situation: I was in charge of training new employees at my job, and our new employee was a mother originally from Moroccol

Task: I needed to train this employee to meet our standards, and I also wanted to make her feel welcome to our company.

Action: This employee struggled with certain aspects of the job, but with some coaching she was able to excel at her work.

Result: This employee became one of my best friends at the company, and she eventually earned multiple propmotions. I still keep in touch with her.
