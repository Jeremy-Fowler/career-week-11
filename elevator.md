Hi, my name is Jeremy Fowler, and I'm a software developer. I was recently a foreperson at a warehouse where I was in charge of managing and training employees. After 5 years of working in this position, I realized that the opportunities that my job was offering me did not interest me. My wife pushed me towards software development, and I quickly fell in love with it. I want to learn as much as I can about coding, and I would love to work with a team of like-minded peers.
